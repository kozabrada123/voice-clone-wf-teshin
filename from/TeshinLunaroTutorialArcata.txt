To get possession of the Lunaro, you simply touch it. It will pull into your arm-mounted launcher, called your 'Arcata'. Launch the Lunaro by tapping the fire button. Holding the fire button for the duration of the throw will launch it further. To curve your shot, try launching the Lunaro from a slide. Your Arcata is also equipped with a range-limited attractor. Hold the aim button to attract the Lunaro when it is near. Catching, interceptions and guarding your team's goal rely on this.
